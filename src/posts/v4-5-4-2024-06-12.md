The Warewulf project is pleased to announce the release of v4.5.4, [now
available on GitHub][1].

[1]: https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf/releases/tag/v4.5.4

Warewulf v4.5.4 fixes a regression that was introduced in v4.5.3 that broke
argument parsing for wwctl container shell and wwctl container exec.

Many thanks for our wonderful community for identifying this issue.

[Let us know][2] if you encounter any issues. [v4.5.5 is already planned][3],
and we intend to continue to improve and maintain [the v4.5.x line][4] while
working on [the next major release, v4.6.0][5].
