The Warewulf project is pleased to announce the release of v4.5.8, [now
available on GitHub][1].

[1]: https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf/releases/tag/v4.5.8

Warewulf v4.5.8 simplifies the "wwinit" boot process for SELinux and configures
tmpfs to spread the node image across all available NUMA nodes. It also
improves the detection of kernels in the container image to more reliably
detect the newest available kernel and to avoid debug / rescue kernels.

This release also includes additional bug fixes and documentation improvements.

[Let us know][2] if you encounter any issues. Our attention is increasingly
focused on [the next major release, v4.6.0][3], but we will continue to
maintain v4.5.x if significant issues are discovered prior to its release.
