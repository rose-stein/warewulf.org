The Warewulf project is pleased to announce the release of v4.5.6, [now
available on GitHub][1].

[1]: https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf/releases/tag/v4.5.6

Warewulf v4.5.6 includes usability improvements and bugfixes for the
v4.5.x line. This includes a significant fix for overlay autobuild,
resolving a bug in v4.5.5 that caused autobuilt overlays to be
empty. We've also added tab completion for the remaining subcommands
of wwctl overlay, and simplified the wwctl container list command to
break-out size calculations as optional and only report one type of
size at a time. (Previously, container size was reported as the sum of
the chroot, the uncompressed archive, and the compressed archive.)

[Let us know][2] if you encounter any issues. [v4.5.7 is already planned][3],
and we intend to continue to improve and maintain [the v4.5.x line][4] while
working on [the next major release, v4.6.0][5].
