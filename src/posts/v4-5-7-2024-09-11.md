The Warewulf project is pleased to announce the release of v4.5.7, [now
available on GitHub][1].

[1]: https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf/releases/tag/v4.5.7

Warewulf v4.5.7 fixes the ability to override overlay files configured in
profiles with overlays configured per-node; fixes a template processing bug bug
in development-time overlay rendering; and improves the preview dracut-based
boot process to better support a "secure" boot process.

It also adds the ability to temporarily copy files into containers for possible
modification during `wwctl container exec` and `wwctl container shell`.

[Let us know][2] if you encounter any issues. [v4.5.8 is already planned][3],
and we intend to continue to improve and maintain [the v4.5.x line][4] while
working on [the next major release, v4.6.0][5].
