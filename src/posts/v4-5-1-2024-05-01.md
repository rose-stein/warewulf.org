The Warewulf project is pleased to announce the release of v4.5.1, [now
available on GitHub][1].

[1]: https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf/releases/tag/v4.5.1

Warewulf v4.5.1 is primarily a bugfix and dependency update release.

Updates to dependencies broke compatibility with CentOS Linux 7, so we have
also dropped support for CentOS 7 (which, itself, goes EOL at the end of June)
in this release. (This only affects the ability to run the Warewulf server on
CentOS 7: Warewulf can still provision compute node images running CentOS 7.)

[Let us know][2] if you encounter any issues. [v4.5.2 is already planned][3],
and we intend to continue to improve and maintain [the v4.5.x line][4] while we
continue working on [the next major release, v4.6.0][5].
