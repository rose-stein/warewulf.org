next major version of Warewulf v4, [now available on GitHub][1].

Warewulf v4.6.0 is a significant upgrade, with many changes relative to the
v4.5.x series:

- new configuration upgrade system
- changes to the default profile
- renaming containers to (node) images
- new kernel management system
- parallel overlay builds
- sprig functions in overlay templates
- improved network overlays
- nested profiles
- arbitrary “resources” data in nodes.conf
- NFS client configuration in nodes.conf
- emphatically optional syncuser
- improved network boot observability
- movements towards Debian/Ubuntu support

Particularly significant changes, especially those affecting the user
interface, are described in the [release notes][2]. Additional changes not
impacting the user interface are listed in the [CHANGELOG][3].
