The Warewulf project is pleased to announce the release of v4.5.3, [now
available on GitHub][1].

[1]: https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf/releases/tag/v4.5.3

Warewulf v4.5.3 includes additional functionality, documentation, usability
improvements, and bugfixes. This includes an initial preview of 2-stage boot
support based on dracut; significant efficiency improvements for "syncuser"; a
remedy for a regression that affected the generation of ssh host keys during
initial configuration; and improved handling of temporary files generated
during container shell and exec commands.

[Let us know][2] if you encounter any issues. We intend to continue to improve
and maintain [the v4.5.x line][4] while we continue working on [the next major
release, v4.6.0][5].
